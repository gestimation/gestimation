## About gestimation/Shiro Tanaka

<img src="../image/portrait.jpg" width="130" style="border-radius: 12px; float:right; margin-left:1rem;"/>

Shiro Tanaka is a biostatistician and a Professor of Clinical Biostatistics at the Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University. This site is his small way of giving back to the community that shaped his training—through books, open-source software, and resources shared generously across borders.


He has served as a trial statistician in nationwide clinical trial groups in oncology (JCOG), pediatric oncology (JCCG), and osteoporosis (A-TOP). He is an advisory expert for the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), serves on the council of the Japanese Society for Pharmacoepidemiology and the Biometric Society of Japan, and is on multiple editorial boards.

He has been fortunate to work with researchers such as Marc A. Brookhart, Jason P. Fine, and Thomas H. Scheike.

## Why "gestimation"?

The name comes from *g-estimation* in causal inference—a class of methods introduced by James Robins. In my own work, I have found this approach especially useful in applied clinical research:

- Tanaka S, Matsuyama Y, Shiraki M, Ohashi Y. Estimating the effects of time-varying osteoporosis treatments on incidence of fractures among Japanese postmenopausal women. Epidemiology 2007;18(5):529–36.

- Tanaka S, Brookhart MA, Fine JP. G-estimation of structural nested mean models for competing risks data using pseudo-observations. Biostatistics 2020;21(4):860–75.

- Tanaka S, Brookhart MA, Fine JP. G-estimation of structural nested mean models for interval-censored data using pseudo-observations. Statistics in Medicine 2023;42(21):3877–91.

These are not required reading for the stories here. But if you ever feel like following the path from coffee chats → DAGs → g-estimation, this is one of the places it eventually leads.
