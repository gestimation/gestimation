A daughter taking her first steps into research and her Dad, a statistician. After advising her to organize her research hypothesis from "PICO" into "PECO," the daughter—an oncologist—decides to study the relationship between having a stoma and returning to work among cancer survivors. She also learns that even for the same "return-to-work outcome," there are at least two analytic paths: treating it as binary data or treating it as time-to-event data. Then she remembers a paper her supervisor recommended—one that used the terms OS and DFS.

### Making sense of the numbers around survival curves

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-father
Dad: "Hmm? It's getting cold—what are you still reading this late? Want me to make coffee?"
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "Oh—thanks, Dad. Milk too, please. I'm reading a paper on gastric cancer surgery. Hey, you once explained the difference between overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), right?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "That does ring a bell."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "Do you read clinical papers too, for work?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Sometimes. I work as a statistician for clinical trials, so I do. But more often I'm on the writing side of papers. And I don't really need the latest clinical details for my day-to-day work."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "Good. Because there are details in this paper that I don't understand—especially the words that feel 'statistical.' Look at this figure. It's from a randomized trial comparing surgical approaches for gastric cancer, called JCOG9502 (Sasako et al. 2006). The TH group received the standard procedure—approaching the lower mediastinum from a laparotomy incision. The LTA group underwent lower mediastinal dissection as well, through a continuous left thoracoabdominal incision."

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-father
Dad: "This is what people call a **Kaplan-Meier curve**. Panel A is OS, and Panel B is DFS. In both panels, the TH group (the blue curve) sits above the LTA group (the red curve). That means the TH group had better outcomes."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "That part I get. It's the small details I'm stuck on. The first thing that tripped me up was the **number at risk** under the curves. That's the number of patients still under observation at each time point, right? Look at the numbers at time zero. In Panel A it's 82 and 85, but in Panel B it's 76 and 75. The sample sizes differ between the two analyses. Do you know why?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "That's a hard one. In a randomized trial, excluding participants from the analysis usually means something serious—like a major protocol deviation. Can I get a refill? …Hmm. To analyze DFS, you need to be able to evaluate whether recurrence occurred. Is there any reason why that might not be assessable for some patients?"
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "Right—if the tumor wasn't completely resected, maybe they didn't treat it as 'recurrence' in the DFS definition. Let me check… The paper says there were 151 patients who had an R0 resection. That's probably part of it. And another thing: after around year seven, the number at risk drops to just a handful of patients. What do you make of that?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "That depends. How long was accrual, and how long was follow-up?"
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "Accrual was from 1995 to 2003—eight years. And it says survival time data up to 2006 were analyzed. So the minimum follow-up is around three years, maybe."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Then not everyone can be followed for more than three years, right? We talked before about **censoring**. Time-to-event data are made of events and censoring. Having a lot of censoring within the first three years would be suspicious—but censoring after three years can simply reflect the planned end of follow-up."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "But papers don't tell you when censoring happened, do they?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "They do. See those little tick marks on the curve."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "These tiny spikes?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Yes. Those marks indicate censoring. If you saw many tick marks right after time zero, what would you suspect? It would mean patients became untraceable soon after the study began—so they were censored early. That kind of pattern can hint at bias."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "In this figure, there are only a few tick marks within three years. So most patients were followed for at least three years. That sounds like a well-run study. Let me summarize what we just said—something like this?"
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

- The number at risk shows how many people remain under observation at each time point.
- Tick marks indicate censoring.
- The figure doesn't show everything; you should also check the accrual period and planned follow-up.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "But textbooks don't teach you this kind of thing. They're all means and regression coefficients."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Survival analysis tends to be pushed to the back of many general statistics textbooks. If you want to learn how cancer clinical trial data are actually analyzed, a clinical trials textbook written by statisticians from the US cooperative group SWOG is more useful than a general statistics text (Green et al. 2013)."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "Come to think of it, it took more than ten years to produce this figure. The staff must have worked incredibly hard. By the way—last time we talked about trial protocols. You submit the protocol to each site's ethics committee, right? And once it's approved, you basically don't change it—because changing it means paperwork."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "That's right."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Daughter: "It's scary, putting a plan into words while looking ten years ahead—without even knowing who will read it. And more than a hundred patients are involved. I can see why you'd want to pin down what each endpoint means, even at the level of wording. Oh—and about English terms around survival curves: how would you say 'hazard ratio,' '95% CI,' 'one-sided p,' and 'two-sided p' in Japanese?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Usually: hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval, one-sided p-value, and two-sided p-value—basically loanwords with standard Japanese phrasing. These are classic survival-analysis outputs. Hazard ratios and p-values often come from Cox regression, but we can talk about that properly another day—when we have time."

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="A quiz related to this episode"}

To explain prognosis, clinicians sometimes talk about "life expectancy" or remaining lifetime. Can you read "life expectancy after gastric cancer surgery" from the JCOG9502 figure?

1.  You can read it from Panel A (the OS Kaplan-Meier curve).
2.  You can read it from Panel B (the DFS Kaplan-Meier curve).
3.  You cannot read it from either Panel A or Panel B.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="Answer"}
-   The correct answer is **1**.

To summarize survival time, people use the mean or the median, but the **median survival time** is easier to read from a figure.

Survival time is numerical (measured in days or years), so it behaves like continuous data in many respects. For continuous data, the median is the value corresponding to the top 50%, right? Once at least half of participants experience the event—so their survival times are "observed"—you can estimate the median survival time even in the presence of censoring.

Concretely, the median survival time corresponds to the time when survival reaches 50%—that is, the point where the OS Kaplan–Meier curve in Panel A falls to 50%. You simply read off the time at which the curve crosses that level.
