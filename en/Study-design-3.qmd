### What exactly is an “outcome”?

Me: “Hey Dad, can I pick your brain again?”

Dad: “That depends. Is there coffee involved?”

Me: “Already poured.  
So… about *outcomes*.  

In journal club, all these abbreviations show up: **OS**, **DFS**, **RFS**, **PFS**…  
Everyone talks like they’re obvious, but I’m honestly fuzzy on the details.  

I know they’re supposed to be outcomes,  
but what’s really different between things like **DFS** and **RFS**?  
You deal with these all the time, right?”

Dad: “I do.  
The one you probably see most is **OS**: overall survival.  

Then there’s:

- **DFS**: disease-free survival  
- **RFS**: relapse-free survival.”

Me: “RFS sounds like ‘number of days until relapse’ in my head.”

Dad: “If we literally meant ‘number of days until relapse’,  
we’d probably call it **relapse-free time**.  
You’ll also see terms like **cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR)**.”

Me: “Acronyms are multiplying, not shrinking. Help.”

Dad: “Let’s slow it down.  

In survival analysis, we’re always looking at **time from some origin to an event**.  
The twist is what we call an **event**.

For **DFS**, we often count as events:

- recurrence,  
- second primary cancer, and  
- death.

We’re asking:  

> ‘How long do patients stay alive **without recurrence and without second cancer**?’”

Me: “So if someone gets a second cancer,  
that’s already an event in DFS, even if they’re alive.”

Dad: “Exactly.

For **RFS**, it’s usually:

- **recurrence**, and  
- **death**.

Second cancers generally don’t count as events there.”

Me: “And OS is just: time to death, period.”

Dad: “Right.  

So if you look at 3-year OS and 3-year DFS for the same trial:

- 3-year **DFS** ≤ 3-year **OS**,  
  because DFS counts **more things** as events.”

Me: “Got it.  
But from a patient’s point of view,  
‘no recurrence and no second cancer’ sounds pretty important.  

So DFS feels meaningful.  
RFS… I’m less sure.  
And death is obviously the most serious event of all.”

Dad: “Agreed.  
But notice:

- If someone **relapses** and later dies,  
  they’re already an event in RFS at the time of relapse,  
  even before death.  

- If someone dies **before relapse**,  
  the cause might be an infection, accident,  
  or something unrelated to the original cancer.”

Me: “So not all deaths are equal in terms of ‘cancer story’.”

Dad: “Exactly.  

Let me show you a simplified table  
of common **survival endpoints in cancer trials**.  
Think of it as a map, not a legal document.”

### Major survival endpoints in oncology (conceptual map)

| Endpoint                           | What counts as an event? (conceptually)                          |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overall survival (**OS**)         | Death from any cause                                             |
| Progression-free survival (**PFS**)| Progression/relapse **or** death                                 |
| Relapse-free survival (**RFS**)   | Relapse **or** death                                             |
| Relapse-free time (**RFT**)      | Relapse only                                                     |
| Disease-free survival (**DFS**)   | Relapse, second cancer, **or** death                             |
| Event-free survival (**EFS**)     | Death, induction failure, relapse, second cancer (depends on trial) |

Dad: “The key idea is:

- OS cares only about **death**.  
- DFS cares about **any recurrence / second cancer / death**.  
- RFS sits in between.”

Me: “Okay, that really helps.  
And the **time origin** is… usually when treatment starts?”

Dad: “Good question.  

Common choices for the **time origin** are:

- date of **surgery**,  
- date of **randomization/registration** in a trial,  
- or sometimes date of **diagnosis**.

For **postoperative adjuvant therapy**,  
using the **date of surgery** is natural.  

If you used date of discharge instead,  
deaths before discharge would be invisible in your analysis,  
which can be a big problem.”

Me: “So if I’m evaluating adjuvant chemo after surgery,  
time zero = surgery date is the cleanest.  
If I pick a weird origin, I’m basically throwing away part of the story.”

Dad: “Exactly.  
Time origin is like the zero point on your ruler:  
if you set it wrong, all the distances become hard to interpret.”

### Simulating OS, RFS, and relapse incidence (CIR)

Dad: “Want to see how OS, RFS, and CIR behave in data?”

Me: “That’s a dangerous question, but yes.”

Dad: “Let’s use R again.  
We’ll simulate two groups:

- **With stoma**  
- **Without stoma**

We’ll give the stoma group a higher risk of:

- **relapse** and  
- **death**

and see how that shows up in:

- OS curves  
- RFS curves  
- **cumulative incidence of relapse** (CIR).”

### R code: generating data with relapse and death

```r
generate_data <- function(n = 200, hr1, hr2) {
  # Stoma: 1 = with stoma, 0 = without stoma
  stoma <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.4)
  # Sex: 0 = WOMAN, 1 = MAN
  sex <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
  # Age: normal distribution (stoma group slightly older)
  age <- rnorm(n, mean = 65 + 3 * stoma, sd = 8)

  # Hazards for relapse and death
  # (larger hazard = earlier event)
  hazard_relapse   <- ifelse(stoma == 1, hr1 * 0.10, 0.10)
  hazard_death     <- ifelse(stoma == 1, hr2 * 0.10, 0.10)
  hazard_censoring <- 0.05

  # Latent times to relapse, death, and censoring
  t_relapse   <- rexp(n, rate = hazard_relapse)
  t_death     <- rexp(n, rate = hazard_death)
  t_censoring <- rexp(n, rate = hazard_censoring)

  ## --- Overall survival (OS) ---
  time_os   <- pmin(t_death, t_censoring)
  status_os <- as.integer(t_death <= t_censoring)  # 1 = death, 0 = censored

  ## --- Relapse-free survival (RFS) ---
  time_rfs   <- pmin(t_relapse, t_death, t_censoring)
  status_rfs <- integer(n)
  status_rfs[time_rfs == t_relapse & time_rfs < t_censoring] <- 1  # relapse
  status_rfs[time_rfs == t_death   & time_rfs < t_censoring] <- 1  # death

  ## --- Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) ---
  time_cir <- pmin(t_relapse, t_death, t_censoring)

  # 1 = relapse (event of interest), 2 = death (competing risk)
  status_cir <- integer(n)
  status_cir[time_cir == t_relapse & time_cir < t_censoring] <- 1
  status_cir[time_cir == t_death   & time_cir < t_censoring] <- 2

  data.frame(
    id         = 1:n,
    sex        = factor(sex, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("WOMAN", "MAN")),
    age        = age,
    stoma      = factor(stoma, levels = c(0, 1),
                        labels = c("WITHOUT STOMA", "WITH STOMA")),
    time_os    = time_os,
    status_os  = status_os,
    time_rfs   = time_rfs,
    status_rfs = status_rfs,
    time_cir   = time_cir,
    status_cir = status_cir
  )
}


Kaplan–Meier curves for OS and RFS
# devtools::install_github("gestimation/cifmodeling") # if needed
library(cifmodeling)

set.seed(46)
dat <- generate_data(hr1 = 2, hr2 = 1.5)

# Overall survival (OS)
cifplot(
  Event(time_os, status_os) ~ stoma,
  data         = dat,
  outcome.type = "survival",
  label.y      = "Overall survival"
)

# Relapse-free survival (RFS)
cifplot(
  Event(time_rfs, status_rfs) ~ stoma,
  data         = dat,
  outcome.type = "survival",
  label.y      = "Relapse-free survival"
)


With stoma: higher hazards → lower curves

OS curve lies above the RFS curve,
because RFS counts more kinds of events

Aalen–Johansen curve for cumulative incidence of relapse

Now let’s focus on relapse as the event of interest,
and treat death without prior relapse as a competing risk.

Me: “Competing risk…
like an event that ‘steals the chance’ for relapse to happen?”

Dad: “Exactly.
If a patient dies before relapse,
we’ll never see relapse in that patient’s timeline.
Death ‘competes’ with relapse.”

In the code below:

status_cir = 1 → relapse (event of interest)

status_cir = 2 → death as competing risk

status_cir = 0 → censored

cifplot(
  Event(time_cir, status_cir) ~ stoma,
  data         = dat,
  outcome.type = "competing-risk",
  label.y      = "Cumulative incidence of relapse"
)


Me: “The curve for relapse looks a bit like a survival curve turned upside down.”

Dad: “Visually, yes.
But conceptually it’s different.

If you used Kaplan–Meier for relapse,
you’d treat deaths as censored —
as if they just disappeared from the risk set.

But death isn’t the same as ‘lost to follow-up’.
It’s a real, meaningful event.

So for competing risks,
we prefer the Aalen–Johansen estimator for cumulative incidence,
which respects the fact that death is another type of event.”

Me: “So:

OS and RFS → Kaplan–Meier

Relapse incidence with death as competing risk → Aalen–Johansen

That’s the big picture?”

Dad: “Exactly.
Choosing ‘who is an event’ and ‘who is a competing risk’
changes how we interpret the outcome.”

Clinical endpoints vs surrogate endpoints

Me: “By the way, in journal club people love to say:

‘OS is the only real endpoint.
DFS is just a surrogate.’

Is that fair?”

Dad: “It’s… simplified.

Regulators and guidelines often treat OS
as a clinical endpoint—
an outcome that directly reflects patient benefit.

Things like DFS or PFS are often used as surrogate endpoints.

A surrogate endpoint is:

an outcome intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint,
and expected to predict clinical benefit or harm.”

Me: “The obvious advantage is that you can finish the trial earlier, right?
You don’t have to wait for OS to mature.”

Dad: “Exactly.
Shorter trials, faster answers.

But there’s a risk:
sometimes surrogates don’t predict OS well.

There are famous examples where a regimen improved:

tumor response rate, or

PFS,

but had little or no impact on overall survival.

So we have to be careful:

Surrogates can be very useful,

but they’re not automatically ‘good enough’ on their own.”

Me: “So in practice,
we often look at OS when possible,
and use DFS / PFS with a bit of skepticism and context.”

Dad: “That’s a healthy attitude.”

A quiz related to this episode

Which of the following statements about endpoints in cancer trials is the most appropriate?

OS is always better than any surrogate endpoint and should be the primary endpoint in every trial.

DFS and PFS are acceptable primary endpoints only when they perfectly predict OS.

Surrogate endpoints like DFS and PFS can shorten trial duration,
but may sometimes lead to misleading conclusions about clinical benefit.

Once a surrogate endpoint is validated in one setting,
it can be used in all tumor types without further evaluation.

Answer

The correct answer is 3.

1: In some settings, using OS as the primary endpoint is simply not practical
(e.g., very long post-relapse survival).

2: “Perfect prediction” is unrealistic;
we usually look for reasonable evidence that the surrogate tracks clinical benefit.

4: Validation of a surrogate is context-dependent—
cancer type, treatment, and disease stage all matter.

Surrogate endpoints are tools.
How we use them — and how cautious we are —
can change how we judge a treatment’s value.
