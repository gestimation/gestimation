### A Quiet Morning Before Submission

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
The sound of the rainy season's rain soothes the stillness of the night. After clinic hours, we often spend time at our computers. Tonight, too, I gazed at the manuscript displayed on my monitor. On the desk papers and survey qeforms, and beside a note scribbled on a paper napkin, a Rubik's Cube sat quietly. I reached for the coffee, now lukewarm.


The sound of early-summer rain softened what remained of the night. After clinic hours, we often spent time at our computers. Tonight again, I sat still, looking at the manuscript glowing on the monitor. On the desk papers, questionnaires, and beside a note scribbled on a paper napkin, a Rubik's Cube sat quietly. I reached for the coffee, now lukewarm.

Write, pause, return. Again and again.

"The aim of this study was―"

::: voice-daughter
Such a short sentence, and yet now I know how much it must hold. A study aim is never a private intention. It must be opened to others, shaped into a research hypothesis― something that quietly hands over where I stand in the world and the direction in which I intend to walk.

My eyes moved downward.
:::

"The major results of the study were―"

::: voice-daughter
The numbers placed there look different to me than before. Numbers are records of what happened to patients, but they are also responses to the questions we ask of the world. Did we provide good care? Change the question, and the numbers answer differently. They appear merely arranged on the page, yet each one speaks more than I once imagined.

Because this study involves patients, its hypothesis inevitably carries the values of medicine. It is less about knowing what is “correct,” and more about gaining knowledge that brings us a little closer to better practice. 

The coffee had cooled at the corner of the desk. On the monitor, the freshly written Conclusion glowed softly. I checked each line, making sure it answered the questions we held when we designed the study. I nodded to myself and began typing again, slowly.
