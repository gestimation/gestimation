# Brewing coffee, exchanging words. As the steam drifts upward, time softens, and the world of statistics opens little by little.


These small conversations between a statistician father and his clinician daughter became the seed of this site. Questions born in the middle of research, numbers that snagged while reading a paper, and occasionally, glimpses of how researchers carry themselves—the things that truly matter tend to be scattered quietly across multiple layers: everyday life, clinical practice, causality, data, cognition, and language. 

Over coffee, their light conversation gathers these fragments one by one, as if weaving them into a single story without disturbing their totality.

From survival curves and misread p-values to the layered relationship between causality and statistical inference—
the episodes hide small clues like a gentle spiral, yet speak in words warm enough to hold between your hands on a winter morning.

Mathematics and medicine make their appearances, but feel free to take only what you need. Every discussion can be reproduced in R. And as their dialogue unfolds, so too does a subtle shift in how the world appears.

Enjoy following that changing view, at the quiet pace of a cup of coffee.

## Episodes

### 1. Study Design — Where research begins

Every study starts with a question. How do we frame PICO/PECO? How do we choose outcomes? How do we protect against bias? The daughter asks her father about the very starting point of clinical research.

- [A Story of Coffee Chat and Research Hypothesis](study-design-1.html)

- **A Story of Coffee Chat and Research Hypothesis**
Research often begins not with data, but with a question that has not yet found its shape. 
- **Data Have Types: A Coffee-Chat Guide to R Functions for Common Outcomes**
Numbers may look the same, yet describe different worlds—this pause starts from the idea of data types.
- **Outcomes: The Bridge from Data Collection to Analysis**
The moment an outcome is defined, much of the study is already decided—quietly revisiting that choice.
- **A First Step into Survival and Competing Risks Analysis with R**
Before analysis begins, we stop to ask whether an event is truly singular—thinking in terms of time and events.
- **When Bias Creeps In: Selection, Information, and Confounding in Clinical Surveys**
Distortion rarely comes from formulas alone—this is where bias quietly enters.

### 2. Glossary — The words of statistics

- [Statistical Terms in Plain Language]

### 3. Frequentist Thinking — Practicing statistics

Using cancer clinical trials as an example, my father explains the **frequentist perspective** of “How do numbers behave when you virtually repeat a study in a long run?”

- [Reading a Paper over a Cup of Coffee]
- [P-Value Explanations That Seem Plausible at First Glance]
- [Beyond 0.05: Interpreting P-Values in a Clinical Trial]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}
- **Reading a Paper over a Cup of Coffee**
The unease felt while reading a paper often comes from language — pausing over statistical terms.
- **P-Value Explanations That Seem Plausible at First Glance**
What would happen if the same study were repeated again and again — touching the idea of frequentist thinking.
- **Beyond 0.05: Interpreting P-Values in a Clinical Trial**
A p-value is less a number than a shadow of design — watching where interpretation drifts.

### 4. Frequentist Experiments — Validation of statistics

The laws derived from the frequentist theory are not mere abstractions; they can be verified through simulation experiments. Even if you are unfamiliar with R, simply run the script to reproduce the results.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}
- **R Demonstration of Bias in Kaplan-Meier Under Competing Risks**
A curve that looks convincing may still describe another world — checked through simulation.
- **Understanding Confidence Intervals via Hypothetical Replications in R**
Where does "95%" come from, and where does it go — lingering over confidence intervals.
- **Alpha, Beta, and Power: The Fundamental Probabilities Behind Sample Size**
Planning of sample size is also the planning of error of the study. Revisiting the foundations of frequentist design.

### 5. Effects and Time — How effects evolve

We unravel risk differences, risk ratios, hazard ratios, vaccine effectiveness rates, attributable fractions, and effects that change over time alongside survival curves and cumulative incidence curves. A multidimensional perspective on data quietly develops, paving the way for causal inference.

- [Silent Confusions Hidden in Percentages]
- [Who Is This Percentage About? Target Populations and Attributable Fractions]
- [Understanding Collapsibility of Effect Measures in Marginal and Stratified Analyses with R]
- [When Odds Ratios Approximate Risk Ratios—and When They Fail]
- [From Risk and Rate to Survival and Hazard]
- [Distinguishing Time-Point, Time-Constant, and Time-Varying Effects: An R Example]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}
- **Silent Confusions Hidden in Percentages**
Percentages feel intuitive, yet they often mislead. Rethinking how effects are communicated.
- **Who Is This Percentage About—Target Populations and Attributable Fractions**
Every number speaks about someone — reconsidering the assumed population.
- **Understanding Collapsibility of Effect Measures in Marginal and Stratified Analyses with R**
When adjustment changes results, the reason is structural — revisiting stratification.
- **When Odds Ratios Approximate Risk Ratios—and When They Fail**
Measures that look similar may behave differently — pausing over the odds ratio.
- **From Risk and Rate to Survival and Hazard**
Once time enters the picture, effects change shape. An entry point to thinking about effects over time.
- **Distinguishing Time-Point, Time-Constant, and Time-Varying Effects**
Are effects ever constant — considering time-varying perspectives.

- [Where My Logistic Regression Went Wrong]
- [Why Logistic Regression Fails in Small Samples]
- [Simpson's paradox]
