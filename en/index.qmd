# Brew a coffee, start a conversation. As the steam rises and fades, time passes — and the world of statistics slowly opens up.

This site grew out of small coffee chats between a statistician father and his physician daughter. Over coffee, they move back and forth between clinic and code, papers and everyday life — turning “I sort of get this” moments into questions they can actually work through.

Even when the topic is a difficult statistical method or a messy formula, we try to explain it in words with warmth, like the heat from a mug on a winter evening.  
Each story can be reproduced with R code. Whether you want to learn deeply or just pause for a moment, you can read these as short essays for quiet nights — at your own pace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Series

### 1. Study design — Where research begins

Every study starts with a question. How do we frame PICO/PECO? How do we choose outcomes? How do we protect against bias? The daughter asks her father about the very starting point of clinical research.

- [Study design I](study-design-1.qmd)
- [Study design II](study-design-2.qmd)
- [Study design III]
- [Study design IV]
- [Study design V]

You can download the full R script for this episode here. If you are curious about the R packages and concrete analysis steps, feel free to take a look.

- [study-design.R](../from-coffee-chat-to-r/study-design.R)

### 2. Frequentist thinking — Practicing statistics

Using a cancer clinical trial as a running example, the father talks about the **frequentist idea** of “what would happen to these numbers if we could repeat the study many times?”

- [Frequentist thinking I]
- [Frequentist thinking II]
- [Frequentist thinking III]
- [Frequentist thinking IV]
- [Frequentist thinking V]

### 3. Effects and time — How effects evolve

Risk difference, risk ratio, hazard ratio, vaccine efficacy, attributable fractions, and **effects that change over time** are explored through survival curves and cumulative incidence functions. Before stepping fully into causal inference, you quietly develop a three-dimensional way of looking at data.

- [Effects and time I]
- [Effects and time II]
- [Effects and time III]
- [Effects and time IV]
- [Effects and time V]

### 4. Adjusting for bias — The landscape of regression

Here we meet **logistic regression for adjustment** and **confounding** — what it is, and what it is not.

- [Adjusting for bias I]
- [Adjusting for bias II]
- [Adjusting for bias III]
- [Adjusting for bias IV]

### 5. Causal inference — Thinking about “what if”

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), common causes, colliders, mediators, backdoor paths. We try to talk about the **language of causality** needed to think about “what would have happened if...?”, using as few formulas as possible.

- [Causal inference I]
- [Causal inference II]
- [Causal inference III]
- [Causal inference IV]

### 6. The Craft of Research — The work of doing research

How do we present results? How do we design figures and tables? How do we revise a manuscript, and how do we live with peer review? This series is a quiet set of lectures on “life after statistics” for people doing research.

- [The Craft of Research I]
- [The Craft of Research II]
- [The Craft of Research III]
- [The Craft of Research IV]

## How to read this site

- If you start with **Study design I–V**,  
  you will get a first outline of “what question to ask, and what data to collect to answer it.”
- If you want to choose by interest:
  - **To build a better footing for reading papers** → Frequentist thinking / Effects and time  
  - **To tidy up your analysis practice** → Adjusting for bias  
  - **To organize how you think about causality** → Causal inference  
  - **To eventually publish your work as a paper** → The Craft of Research
- Each episode is written so that you *can* read it on its own.  
  But if you read across the series, a mental map of “what research is as a practice” starts to form in the background.

Pick any place that catches your eye, grab your favourite drink, and read at the pace that feels right for you.
