# Brewing coffee, exchanging words. As the steam drifts upward, time softens, and the world of statistics opens little by little.


These small conversations between a statistician father and his clinician daughter became the seed of this site. Questions born in the middle of research, numbers that snagged while reading a paper, and occasionally, glimpses of how researchers carry themselves—the things that truly matter tend to be scattered quietly across multiple layers: everyday life, clinical practice, causality, data, cognition, and language. 

Over coffee, their light conversation gathers these fragments one by one, as if weaving them into a single story without disturbing their totality.

From survival curves and misread p-values to the layered relationship between causality and statistical inference—
the episodes hide small clues like a gentle spiral, yet speak in words warm enough to hold between your hands on a winter morning.

Mathematics and medicine make their appearances, but feel free to take only what you need. Every discussion can be reproduced in R. And as their dialogue unfolds, so too does a subtle shift in how the world appears.

Enjoy following that changing view, at the quiet pace of a cup of coffee.

## Episodes

### 1. Study Design — Where research begins

Every study starts with a question. How do we frame PICO/PECO? How do we choose outcomes? How do we protect against bias? The daughter asks her father about the very starting point of clinical research.

- Want to understand the meaning of numbers and the practice of statistical analysis more deeply: Effects and Time / Adjusting for bias
- Want to organize the invisible structure of causality: Causal Inference
- Want to see the process through to shaping and delivering your research: Publish a Paper

While each episode stands independently, reading the whole reveals how everyday life, clinical practice, causality, data, cognition, and language connect as one flow. Gradually, a map of the research endeavor sketches itself in your mind. Grab your favorite drink and enjoy the journey of conversation between the two.
