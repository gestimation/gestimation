# Brewing coffee, exchanging words. As the steam drifts upward, time softens, and the world of statistics opens little by little.


These small conversations between a statistician father and his clinician daughter became the seed of this site. Questions born in the middle of research, numbers that caught me while reading a paper, and occasionally, glimpses of how researchers conduct themselves—the things that truly matter tend to lie scattered quietly—across everyday life, clinical practice, causality, data, cognition, and language.

Over coffee, their light conversation gathers these fragments one by one, as if weaving them into a single story, careful not to disturb their totality.

From survival curves and misread p-values to the layered relationship between causality and statistical inference — the episodes hide small clues, arranged like a gentle spiral, yet speak in words warm enough to hold between your hands on a winter morning.

Mathematics and medicine make their appearances, but feel free to take only what you need. Some episodes can be reproduced in R. And as their dialogue unfolds, so too does a subtle shift in how the world appears. Enjoy following that changing view, at the quiet pace of a cup of coffee.

## How to read this site

Not sure where to begin? Start with **Study Design**.

Each episode can be read on its own. From there, you can follow the story or choose whichever layer interests you. A few recommendations: [clinical trials and p-values](frequentist-1.html), and [causal inference in research](logistic-regression-1.html). Some episodes include short R scripts—not to teach programming, but to help you feel how causal questions and statistical assumptions take shape in data. Reading through the whole series connects scattered meanings, and you'll surely gain some insights.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="R scripts for reproducing the episodes"}
If you came here from an R post, you may want the code first. These scripts are meant to *reproduce the figures and ideas*, not to teach programming.

- **Frequentist Thinking / Experiments:** `frequentist.R`
- **Effects and Time:** `effects.R`
- **Adjusting for Bias:** `logistic-regression.R`

## Episodes

### 1. Study Design — Where research begins

Every study starts with a question. How do we frame PICO/PECO? How do we choose outcomes? How do we protect against bias? The daughter asks her father about the very starting point of clinical research.

- [A Story of Coffee Chat and Research Hypothesis](study-design-1.html)
- [Data Have Types: A Coffee-Chat Guide to R Functions for Common Outcomes](study-design-2.html)
- [Outcomes: The Bridge from Data Collection to Analysis](study-design-3.html)
- [A First Step into Survival and Competing Risks Analysis with R](study-design-4.html)
- [When Bias Creeps In: Selection, Information, and Confounding in Clinical Surveys](study-design-5.html)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}

- **A Story of Coffee Chat and Research Hypothesis**
Research often stumbles first not on data, but on how a question is framed.
- **Data Have Types: A Coffee-Chat Guide to R Functions for Common Outcomes**
Numbers may look the same, yet describe different worlds—this pause starts from outcome types and the probability models behind them.
- **Outcomes: The Bridge from Data Collection to Analysis**
Once an outcome is defined, much of the study is already decided—pausing over that choice through familiar oncology examples.
- **A First Step into Survival and Competing Risks Analysis with R**
Before analysis begins, trouble often begins with how events are defined and coded—thinking in terms of time and events.
- **When Bias Creeps In: Selection, Information, and Confounding in Clinical Surveys**
Distortion rarely comes from formulas alone—this is where bias quietly enters.

### 2. Glossary — The words of statistics

- [Statistical Terms in Plain Language](glossary.html)

### 3. Frequentist Thinking — Practicing statistics

Using cancer clinical trials as an example, my father explains the **frequentist perspective** of “How do numbers behave under repeated sampling?”

- [Reading a Paper over a Cup of Coffee]
- [P-Value Explanations That Seem Plausible at First Glance]
- [Beyond 0.05: Interpreting P-Values in a Clinical Trial]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}
- **Reading a Paper over a Cup of Coffee**
The unease felt while reading a paper often comes from language — pausing over statistical terms.
- **P-Value Explanations That Seem Plausible at First Glance**
What would happen if the same study were repeated again and again — touching the idea of frequentist thinking.
- **Beyond 0.05: Interpreting P-Values in a Clinical Trial**
A p-value is less a number than a shadow of design — watching where interpretation drifts.

### 4. Frequentist Experiments — Validation of statistics

The laws derived from the frequentist theory are not mere abstractions; they can be verified through simulation experiments. Even if you are unfamiliar with R, simply run the script to reproduce the results.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}
- **R Demonstration of Bias in Kaplan-Meier Under Competing Risks**
A curve that looks convincing may still describe another world — checked through simulation.
- **Understanding Confidence Intervals via Hypothetical Replications in R**
Where does "95%" come from, and where does it go — lingering over confidence intervals.
- **Alpha, Beta, and Power: The Fundamental Probabilities Behind Sample Size**
Planning of sample size is also the planning of error of the study. Revisiting the foundations of frequentist design.

### 5. Effects and Time — How effects evolve

We unravel risk differences, risk ratios, hazard ratios, vaccine effectiveness, attributable fractions, and effects that change over time alongside survival curves and cumulative incidence curves. A multidimensional perspective on data quietly develops, paving the way for causal inference.

- [Silent Confusions Hidden in Percentages]
- [Who Is This Percentage About? Target Populations and Attributable Fractions]
- [Understanding Collapsibility of Effect Measures: Marginal vs Stratified]
- [When Odds Ratios Approximate Risk Ratios—and When They Fail]
- [From Risk and Rate to Survival and Hazard]
- [Distinguishing Time-Point, Time-Constant, and Time-Varying Effects: An R Example]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}
- **Silent Confusions Hidden in Percentages**
Percentages feel intuitive, yet they often mislead. Rethinking how effects are communicated.
- **Who Is This Percentage About—Target Populations and Attributable Fractions**
Every number speaks about someone — reconsidering the assumed population.
- **Understanding Collapsibility of Effect Measures: Marginal vs Stratified**
When adjustment changes results, the reason is structural — revisiting stratification.
- **When Odds Ratios Approximate Risk Ratios—and When They Fail**
Measures that look similar may behave differently — pausing over the odds ratio.
- **From Risk and Rate to Survival and Hazard**
Once time enters the picture, effects change shape. An entry point to thinking about effects over time.
- **Distinguishing Time-Point, Time-Constant, and Time-Varying Effects**
Are effects ever constant — considering time-varying perspectives.

### 6. Adjusting for Bias — The landscape of regression modeling

An episode where she learns from her father — from interpreting logistic regression results and creating tables to avoid pitfalls in its use. And then...

- [From Risk to Logistic Regression]
- [Logit: How a Transformation Shapes an Effect]
- [Where My Logistic Regression Went Wrong]
- [Why Logistic Regression Fails in Small Samples]
- [Understanding Confounding in Effect Measures: Marginal vs Stratified]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="A glimpse ahead"}

When overall and subgroup results disagree — revealing a structure of confounding.
