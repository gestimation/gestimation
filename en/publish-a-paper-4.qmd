# Publish a Paper − A Morning Just Before Submission

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A Quiet Morning Before Submission

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
The sound of the early-summer rain soothed the stillness of the night. After clinic hours, we often spent time at our computers. Tonight again, I sat quietly, looking at the manuscript on the monitor.

On the desk, papers and survey forms lay scattered. Beside a note scribbled on a paper napkin, a Rubik’s Cube rested. I reached for the coffee, now lukewarm.

I write, then stop. I stop, then return.

"Background"

::: voice-daughter
In this opening section, many papers are cited, their authors’ names listed one after another.  
They were surely written in rooms much like this one.
:::

"The aim of this study was—"

::: voice-daughter
Such a short sentence, and yet now I know how much it must carry.  
An aim is never a private intention. It must be opened to others, shaped into the form of a research hypothesis.

It quietly conveys where I stand in the world, and the direction in which I intend to walk.

My eyes move downward.

"Methods"

::: voice-daughter
This was the section that took the longest to write. All I had to do was put into words what I had already done—yet explaining it clearly, from the beginning, to someone I do not know is not easy.

I had to fill in what I had taken for granted, and choose words that could be shared and understood in only one way. I write, revise, and read again. I do not dislike this time.
:::

"The major results of the study were—"

::: voice-daughter
The numbers placed there looked different to me than before. They record what happened to patients. At the same time, they are answers returned from the world to the questions we asked.

Did we provide good care? Change the question, and the numbers respond differently. They may appear simply arranged on the page, but they speak more than I once realized.

Because this study involves patients, its hypothesis inevitably carries the values of medicine. It is less about knowing what is “correct,” and more about gaining knowledge that brings us closer to better practice.

Many things pass unnoticed while we are working, or talking with others over coffee. When I am alone, I understand them more clearly.

The coffee had cooled at the edge of the desk. On the monitor, the freshly written Conclusion was displayed.

I checked each line, making sure it answered the questions we held when we designed the study. 

I nodded slightly and began typing again, slowly.
