Me: “Dad, are you still awake? I’m making coffee.”

Dad: “If there’s coffee, I’m awake.  
What are you reading?”

Me: “Thanks. And milk, please.  

I’m reading this **gastric cancer surgery** paper.  
It’s a randomized trial called **JCOG9502** that compares two surgical approaches.  
You know, you explained **OS** and **DFS** to me the other day,  
and now they’re all over this paper. I thought I should actually understand them.”

Dad: “JCOG9502… yes, that’s the trial comparing  
two surgical approaches for tumors near the cardia.” :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Me: “Right. They randomized patients to:

- a **standard transhiatal approach** (the *TH* group), and  
- a **left thoracoabdominal approach** (the *LTA* group).

There’s a figure with two **Kaplan?Meier curves**:

- Figure A: **overall survival (OS)**  
- Figure B: **disease-free survival (DFS)**

In both, the TH group (blue) looks better than the LTA group (red).  
So far so good ? lower curve = worse outcome.  

But what’s confusing me is all the **numbers around the curves**.”

Dad: “Let me guess: the **number at risk** and the little marks on the curves.”

Me: “Exactly.  

Under each figure there’s a row of numbers ?  
that’s the **number at risk**, right?  

Here’s the first thing that bothered me:  
At time zero, the numbers **don’t match** between OS and DFS.

- In the OS figure, it’s **82 vs 85**.  
- In the DFS figure, it’s **76 vs 75**.

Same trial, same randomization…  
so why are they analyzing different numbers of patients?”

Dad: “Good catch.  

In a randomized trial, you usually start with the same number in each arm.  
If the analysis set is smaller,  
it’s often because the outcome definition requires a certain condition.

For **DFS**, you need to know whether  
the tumor was **completely resected** and then followed for recurrence.

Does the paper say anything about ‘R0 resection’?”

Me: “Let me check…  
Here: it says **151 patients** achieved R0 resection.  

So they must be analyzing **DFS only in those R0 patients**  
? which explains why the DFS figure starts with fewer patients  
than the OS figure.”

Dad: “Exactly.  
So:

- OS: almost all eligible randomized patients  
- DFS: only those with **curative (R0) resection**

That’s why the **number at risk at time zero is different** between the two plots.”

Me: “Okay, that makes sense.  
The other thing is the **tail** of the curves.

Around year 7, the numbers at risk get really small ?  
only a few patients left in each group.  

I was wondering:  
does that mean many patients were **lost to follow-up**?”

Dad: “Not necessarily.  

We need to check:

- **accrual period** (when patients were enrolled), and  
- **follow-up period** (up to when outcomes were collected).”

Me: “The paper says:

- Registration period: 1995?2003  
- Survival data analyzed up to 2006

So accrual took about 8 years,  
and they followed up survival until 2006.”

Dad: “Right.  

That means the **minimum** follow-up for the last patients enrolled  
is only about 3 years.

So:

- Not everyone gets 7+ years of follow-up.  
- It’s expected that the **number at risk** shrinks a lot in later years.

For survival time data,  
remember we talked about **censoring** before?  
Survival data consists of:

- **events** (like death), and  
- **censored observations** (end of follow-up without event).”

Me: “I remember.  
But the paper doesn’t list censoring times in a table.  
How am I supposed to see them?”

Dad: “Look at the survival curves again.  
Do you see the little **ticks** on the lines?”

Me: “These small vertical marks?”

Dad: “Yes. Those are the **censoring symbols**.

Each tick marks a time when a patient was **censored** ?  
for example, lost to follow-up or end of planned follow-up.

If you saw a ton of ticks very soon after time zero,  
you’d worry:

> ‘Are patients disappearing from follow-up  
> right after enrollment?’

That could mean serious **bias**.”

Me: “In this figure,  
there are only a few ticks before year 3,  
and more after that.  

So most patients were followed for at least 3 years,  
and later censoring is mainly due to **the study ending**,  
not people disappearing.”

Dad: “Exactly.  
That’s what you want to see.”

Me: “So if I summarize what I’ve learned so far:

- **Number at risk** = how many patients are still under observation  
  (not yet had the event and not censored) at each time point.  
- The little **ticks on the curve** = censoring events.  
- I should also check the **accrual period** and **follow-up period**  
  to interpret long follow-up tails correctly.”

Dad: “Perfect summary.  

Also, notice something else:  
from 1995 to 2006, this trial took **over ten years**  
to complete enrollment and collect survival data.  

Every point on that curve  
represents a lot of work by clinicians, staff,  
and of course patients.”

Me: “Yeah…  
looking at the figure that way makes it feel heavier.”

### Hazard ratio, confidence interval, and p-values

Me: “By the way, around the curves,  
there are all these **stats words**:

- *hazard ratio*  
- *95% CI*  
- *one-sided p*  
- *two-sided p*

I know the English, but I don’t know if I really understand them.”

Dad: “In Japanese we usually say:

- ハザード比 = hazard ratio  
- 95%信頼区間 = 95% confidence interval  
- 片側p値 = one-sided p-value  
- 両側p値 = two-sided p-value

These are classic **frequentist** summaries in survival analysis.

Most of them come from **Cox regression**,  
which estimates **hazard ratios** between groups.”

Me: “And we’re about to dive into those in this series, right?”

Dad: “Exactly.  

In ‘Frequentist thinking’,  
we’ll unpack:

- what hazard ratios actually mean,  
- what a **95% confidence interval** is (and isn’t), and  
- what we’re really saying when we quote a **p-value**.”

Me: “Okay.  
Then for now I’ll just memorize the names  
and wait for the proper explanations.”

### A quiz related to this episode

Sometimes clinicians use **“remaining life expectancy”**  
to explain prognosis after gastrectomy.

Looking at the JCOG9502 figures,  
can we read **postoperative life expectancy** directly from the curves?

1. Yes, from the OS Kaplan?Meier curve (Figure A).  
2. Yes, from the DFS Kaplan?Meier curve (Figure B).  
3. No, we can’t read it directly from either.  

**Answer**

The best choice is **1**.

To describe “how long patients live after surgery”,  
we use **overall survival time**.

Two common summary measures are:

- the **mean** survival time, and  
- the **median** survival time.

From a Kaplan?Meier curve,  
the **median survival time** is easier to read:

- Survival time is a **time-to-event variable** (continuous-like).  
- The **median** is the time by which **50%** of the patients have had the event.  
- On the OS curve, that corresponds to the time when  
  the **survival probability drops to 50%**.

So, if the OS curve reaches 50%,  
you can read off the **median survival time** at that point.

In contrast, DFS mixes together:

- recurrence,  
- second cancers, and  
- death.

It doesn’t directly answer  
“how long do patients live after surgery?”  
So for “remaining life expectancy after surgery”,  
OS is the relevant curve.
