### A daughter beginning her first study and her father, a statistician

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Me: “Dad, you really are a professor in statistics, right?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “In Japan, yes. One of the many.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “My boss keeps telling me it’s time I do ‘some research’ and present at a conference. He’s really into supporting cancer patients in returning to work since the Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control Programs was revised in 2016. Long story short, I think he wants me to run some kind of survey. I’m not against it, but this is clearly your territory, isn’t it? Statistics and all that.” 
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Half my territory, half yours. You see the patients, I only see the data. Do you have anything clinical you want to know? Any hypothesis?” 
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Nope.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Without at least a working hypothesis, it’s hard to design a good study.”
:::


::: voice-daughter
Me: “Seriously? I thought I could collect the data first and figure it out later.
Hmm… if I had to say, I’d want to know what kind of patients have difficulty returning to work.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “For example, that men might have higher return-to-work rates than women?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “I’m interested in sex differences too, but I’m more curious about cancer stage or complications. I work in gastrointestinal surgery, and I wonder whether patients with stomas can return to the same job they had before surgery. Yeah...I’ll start drafting a questionnaire. Thanks!”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Hold on. Have you decided on your **study population** yet?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Hm? Patients who had cancer surgery at our hospital.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Do gastric cancer patients ever receive a stoma?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “It’s not impossible, but honestly, almost never.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Right. If your main interest is stomas, it might make sense to focus on cancers where stomas are common, like rectal cancer.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “...maybe you’re right.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “It’s important to think about who should be surveyed at the design stage. In general, narrowing the target population allows you to ask more detailed questions. And it improves **comparability**. If you want to compare patients with and without stomas, you’d want the cancer type to be consistent.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “You really love using difficult words. But I get it. If patients’ backgrounds vary too much, it becomes hard to compare them. Keeping them similar makes things easier.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “There are statistical methods and R packages to improve comparability too, like `glm()` for regression adjustment, or`CBPS()` for propensity score weighting. But on the other hand, a broader study population increases **generalizability**. If you want to estimate return-to-work rates among cancer survivors, you don’t necessarily need to limit the cancer type. Ideally, you’d collect data from multiple institutions.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “True...it feels strange to call it ‘a survey of cancer survivors’ if it’s only our hospital.
Generalizability means gathering data that are useful for other hospitals too, right?”
:::


::: voice-father
Dad: “In class, I tell my students this:“
:::

> When your clinical question is still vague,  
> try to express it using PICO or PECO
> before you design the study.

::: voice-father
Dad: It sounds fancy, but we call that ‘structuring’ a study.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Structuring...? That sounds suspiciously formal. Okay, I’ve heard the word before.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Then let’s go through it lightly. In PICO/PECO, P stands for Patients or Population. Deciding who your patients are is a key element in study design.”
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

- Which patients or population are being studied (P)
- What exposure or intervention is of interest (E/I)
- What they are compared against (C)
- What outcomes will be evaluated (O)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Me: “I’ve never heard of Exposure or Comparison before...But in my case, it would be patients with versus without a stoma, right? And what’s Outcome?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Exactly. And O is treatment results, prognosis, and endpoints of patients. In statistical analysis, the outcome variable is the most important part. So it’s crucial to define it before you begin.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Can you even define it before the data come in?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “You should, because once the data are collected, you can’t revise it any more.It needs to be set before finalizing the questionnaire. Right...you probably don’t have a concrete image of an outcome yet. But the outcome determines which data you’ll collect and which statistical methods you’ll use. By the way, which software are you planning to use once the data are ready?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “R. My seniors in the department use it.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Are you comfortable with R?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “I took a class in college, but I’ve forgotten most of it.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Then you’ll need to relearn it. And which R functions you use depends entirely on your outcome.”

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="Clinical questions and research hypotheses"}

In daily clinical practice, many questions naturally arise. A question emerging directly from clinical experience is called a clinical question.

When starting a clinical research, what matters is expressing that **clinical question** as a **research hypothesis**. A research hypothesis consists of minimal essential elements, often summarized using PICO/PECO:

- P: Patients/Population
- I/E: Intervention/Exposure
- C: Comparison
- O: Outcome

The I (Intervention) or E (Exposure) differs depending on whether your study is an interventional trial or an observational study such as a cohort, case?control, or cross-sectional study. All can be structured using PECO. 

Here are three examples of research hypotheses using the cancer survivor survey as a theme.

---

#### Example: Research hypothesis 1

Among rectal cancer patients after curative resection in Japan, is there a difference in **return-to-work within one year** between those with and without a stoma?

- P: Rectal cancer patients after curative resection  
- E: Stoma present  
- C: Stoma absent  
- O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)

Here you’d compare the return-to-work proportion between the stoma and non-stoma groups.

What to choose for C (Comparison) is important. If you only know the return-to-work rate in the stoma group, it’s hard to say whether that number is “high” or “low”.  
Having a clear comparison group improves interpretability. 

---

#### Example: Research hypothesis 2

Among cancer patients after curative surgery, does providing a guidebook on balancing work and cancer treatment increase the proportion who return to work within one year?

- P: Patients with cancer after curative surgery  
- E: Received the guidebook  
- C: Did not receive the guidebook  
- O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)

Here P is broader, so the results could potentially apply to a wider range of patients. This is an example of higher generalizability.

---

#### Example: Research hypothesis 3 (exploratory)

“Are sex, age, stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, performance status, comorbidities, stoma, preoperative employment status, household income, cancer insurance, and use of employment support services associated with return-to-work within one year?”

In exploratory studies like this, P is clear, but E and C are **not just one thing** — we’re screening multiple potential risk factors.

So “structuring the question” doesn’t mean you have to force every study into a clean PECO shape. What matters is to identify the **minimal set of elements** needed to design a coherent study for your question. 
:::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Me: ”I see...it would be tough to propose an original hypothesis from scratch, but breaking the study down into components and deciding one by one isn’t so bad. I suppose it’s something I’ll need to learn eventually.”
:::

::: voice-father
Father: “Exactly. Plus, replacing your thinking with specialized terminology early on improves communication. Definitions of diseases and outcomes, detailed treatment regimens, and exposure specifics can varysubtly across clinicians and facilities. If the terminology is vague, confusion follows.”
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="Quiz related to this episode"}

When formulating study design, the Latin expression “ceteris paribus” often appears. Which of the following best describes its meaning?

1. If there is a causal relationship, it will inevitably occur
2. A universally generalizable law
3. All other conditions being equal
4. Observing a sufficiently large amount of data
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="Answer"}
-   The correct answer is **3**.

The concept of “ceteris paribus” is very close to the idea of **comparability** between groups.
