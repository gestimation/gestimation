### A daughter starting her first research, and her statistician father

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Me: “So… you really are a professor in statistics, right?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “In Japan, yes. One of the many.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “My boss keeps telling me it’s time I do ‘some research’ and present at a conference. He’s really into supporting cancer patients in returning to work since the Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control Programs in Japan was revised. Long story short, I think he wants me to run some kind of survey. I’m not against it, but this is clearly your territory, isn’t it? Statistics and all that.” 
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Half my territory, half yours. You see the patients, I only see the data. So, do you have any **clinical question or hypothesis** in mind?” 
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Honestly? Not really. I was sort of hoping I could just collect a lot of data first and think later. Is that illegal?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Not illegal, but not safe. Without at least a working hypothesis, it’s hard to design a good study.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Okay, okay. If I have to say something... I’m curious about which patients have a harder time staying in work. Not just men vs women, but things like tumor stage and treatment. I work in GI surgery, so I keep wondering about patients with a stoma. Can they really keep doing the same job as before surgery?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “That’s already a good start. You’re close to a research question.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Really? I was just thinking out loud. Fine, I guess I’ll start drafting a questionnaire. That actually helped. Thanks.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Hold on. Have you decided on your **study population** yet?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Um... patients with cancer who had surgery at our hospital?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Do you see many stomas in gastric cancer patients?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “It’s not impossible, but honestly, almost never.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Right. If your main interest is stomas, it might make sense to focus on cancers where stomas are common, like rectal cancer.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “So you’re saying narrow the population?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Exactly. If you **narrow the target population**, you can ask **more detailed questions** and improve **comparability** between groups. If you want to compare patients *with* and *without* a stoma, it’s better to keep the cancer site consistent.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Comparability...such a statistics word. But yeah, if the background is all over the place, it’s a mess. I do get that.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “On the other hand, if you **broaden the population**, you gain **generalizability**. If your goal were to estimate the return-to-work rate among all cancer survivors in Japan, you wouldn’t limit the cancer site, and you might want data from multiple hospitals, not just ours.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Right now, with only our hospital, calling it a ‘real-world survey’ would be a bit bold. So ‘high generalizability’ basically means ‘other hospitals could actually use the results as a reference’?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “That’s a good way to put it. See, you *do* think statistically.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Don’t flatter me just to get free clinical consulting.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “In class, I tell my students this:  

> When your clinical question is still vague,  
> try to express it using PICO or PECO
> before you design the study.

It sounds fancy, but it’s just a framework.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “I’ve heard the words PICO, PECO...but nobody really explains what to *do* with them.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Let’s walk through it using your case. In PICO/PECO:
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

- What kind of patients? (**Patients/Population**)  
- What factor are we focusing on? (**Intervention/Exposure**)  
- What are we comparing it to? (**Comparison**)  
- What outcomes are we interested in? (**Outcome**)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-father
These four pieces are like the minimum ingredients for a study recipe. In a clinical trial, we usually talk about Intervention (I). In observational studies like your survey, we talk about Exposure (E).”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Okay, P is like, ‘rectal cancer patients after curative surgery in our hospital’. For E and C... maybe ‘with stoma’ vs ‘without stoma’?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Exactly. And O is your outcome, that is to say, what you want to measure. In your case, something about return to work.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “So outcome is the thing we call OS, DFS, response rate, that kind of stuff?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “Right. In statistical analysis, the **outcome variable** is the most important part. So deciding what the outcome is is a key step in planning.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Can I really fix that before collecting any data? Feels like I’m committing too early.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “If you don’t fix it before designing the questionnaire, you’ll regret it later. Once you start collecting data, by the way, what software are you planning to use?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “R. That’s what everyone in my department uses.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “How comfortable are you with R?”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “We had it in undergrad, but at this point I’ve forgotten everything except that semicolons stress me out less than parentheses.”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “So we’ll need to get you used to R again. Which R functions you use will depend on the **type of outcome** you choose.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “So step zero is:  

1. Turn my vague hunch into a proper question using P, E, C, O
2. Decide on the outcome  
3. Then figure out how to survive R and not embarrass myself at journal club

That’s the plan?”
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: “That’s a very good summary. If you bring me questions like that, I’m happy to be used as a resource.”
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: “Deal. I’ll bring the clinical mess, you translate it into statistics. Very efficient division of labor.”

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="Clinical questions and research hypotheses"}

In everyday clinical work in Japan, you naturally start to notice small curiosities:

- “Do my older patients really have worse outcomes?”  
- “Is this new support program actually helping?”

These are **clinical questions**. To turn them into research, we want to re-express them as **research hypotheses**. A research hypothesis is built from the **minimum elements** needed for study design:

- P: Patients/Population
- I/E: Intervention/Exposure
- C: Comparison
- O: Outcome

That’s exactly what **PICO/PECO** helps you write down.

---

#### Example: Research hypothesis 1

Among rectal cancer patients after curative resection in Japan, is there a difference in **return-to-work within one year** between those with and without a stoma?

- P: Rectal cancer patients after curative resection  
- E: Stoma present  
- C: Stoma absent  
- O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)

Here you’d compare the return-to-work proportion between the stoma and non-stoma groups.

What to choose for C (Comparison) is important. If you only know the return-to-work rate in the stoma group, it’s hard to say whether that number is “high” or “low”.  
Having a clear comparison group improves interpretability. 

---

#### Example: Research hypothesis 2

Among cancer patients after curative surgery, does providing a guidebook on balancing work and cancer treatment increase the proportion who return to work within one year?

- P: Patients with cancer after curative surgery  
- E: Received the guidebook  
- C: Did not receive the guidebook  
- O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)

Here P is broader, so the results could potentially apply to a wider range of patients. This is an example of higher generalizability.

---

#### Example: Research hypothesis 3 (exploratory)

“Are sex, age, stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, performance status, comorbidities, stoma, preoperative employment status, household income, cancer insurance, and use of employment support services associated with return-to-work within one year?”

In exploratory studies like this, P is clear, but E and C are **not just one thing** — we’re screening multiple potential risk factors.

So “structuring the question” doesn’t mean you have to force every study into a clean PECO shape. What matters is to identify the **minimal set of elements** needed to design a coherent study for your question. 
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="A quiz related to this episode"}

When formulating study design, the Latin expression “ceteris paribus” often appears. Which of the following best describes its meaning?

1. If there is a causal relationship, it will inevitably occur
2. A universally generalizable law
3. All other conditions being equal
4. Observing a sufficiently large amount of data
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="Answer"}
-   The correct answer is **3**.

The concept of “ceteris paribus” is very close to the idea of **comparability** between groups.
