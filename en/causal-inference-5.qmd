### The meaning of blocking

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Me: "Let's pick up where we left off, Dad. When you explained DAGs last time, you used the term **blocking**. You said things like 'a **collider** blocks a path.'"
:::

::: voice-father
"I did."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: "So blocking means that the causal flow is stopped, right?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Hm. That phrasing isn't quite precise. Blocking is a property of paths in a DAG. It doesn't directly refer to causality itself. A path is said to be blocked if it contains a collider, or if a non-collider on the path is conditioned on as a confounder."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: "So if there's a collider, the path is blocked automatically. And for a non-collider, the path becomes blocked when we adjust for it."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Exactly. More formally, blocking means that two nodes can be d-separated. It might be worth touching on the definition of d-separation to avoid confusion."
:::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"  title="d-Separation"}
Consider a DAG with three disjoint sets of nodes, denoted by A, B, and C. If the following two conditions hold, then C is said to **d-separate** A and B (Greenland, 1999).

Every path between A and B that does not contain a collider includes at least one element of C.

Suppose C contains a collider that lies on a path between A and B. Even if conditioning on that collider opens the path, the path can still be blocked by conditioning on another element of C.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: dialogue
::: voice-daughter
Me: "This is getting complicated."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "It is. As the number of nodes increases, we have to think in terms of sets of nodes, and the definition becomes harder to parse. That's why it helps to check the meaning in simple cases. Let's look at these three DAGs. Do you think C d-separates E and D in each of them?"
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: "Well, in all three DAGs there's only one path connecting E and D. In the top two, there's no collider, and C lies on the path—so C should d-separate them. What about the bottom one? C is a collider there, and the path E–C–D can't be blocked by any other variable. So it doesn't satisfy the conditions for d-separation."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "Exactly. Statements like **adjusting for a common cause or a mediator blocks a path**, or **adjusting for a collider opens a path**, can all be expressed precisely by that definition. Once DAGs become more complex, you start to see why the definition is useful. Now, in this DAG, which sets of nodes d-separate E and D?"
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: "There's no collider here. So would it be A and C?"
:::

![](causal-inference-4-2.png)

::: voice-father
Dad: "Not just that. Either A alone or C alone also satisfies the conditions for d-separation."
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: "So that means that if we observe either A or C, we can adjust for confounding?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "That's right. Now let's look at one more DAG."
:::

![](causal-inference-4-3.png)

::: voice-daughter
Me: "Still going? I know I asked for this, but let's make this the last one.
Okay—looking at this diagram, A and B each d-separate, right? C is a collider, so it doesn't."
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "That's correct as far as it goes. But those aren't the only possibilities. What about A and C, or B and C? Even though C is a collider, conditioning on A or B blocks the path E ← A → C ← B → D, doesn't it?"
:::

::: voice-daughter
Me: "I see—you're using the second condition. I think I understand when d-separation holds now. But what does this actually mean?"
:::

::: voice-father
Dad: "The main goal today was to explain blocking properly, and maybe it didn't quite click. In the DAG we just discussed, by searching for sets of variables that d-separate E and D, we identified combinations of confounders that prevent bias.
And one more thing: when we replace the nodes in a DAG with random variables, d-separation corresponds exactly to conditional independence. Using this result, we can identify which confounders are needed to identify causal effects. That's the real meaning of the backdoor criterion."

Suppose that, using a DAG, we confirm that C d-separates A and B.
Then it also follows that the random variables A and B are conditionally independent given C (Pearl, 1995).

Which interpretation of this DAG is correct?

1. E and D are conditionally independent given C

2. E and D remain associated even after conditioning on C

![](causal-inference-4-4.png)
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="Answer"}
-   The correct answer is **2**.

The path E ← C → D is blocked by conditioning on C, but the path E → D is not. Therefore, C does not d-separate E and D. Note that in this case, the reason d-separation fails is that a direct causal path between E and D remains. When estimating the effect of E on D, C should still be adjusted for—regardless of whether the direct path E → D exists.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="One more quiz related to this episode"}
Which interpretation of this DAG is correct?

1. E and D are independent without conditioning on C, and also conditionally independent given C

2. E and D are associated without conditioning on C, but conditionally independent given C

3. E and D are independent without conditioning on C, but become associated after conditioning on C

4. E and D are associated without conditioning on C, and remain associated even after conditioning on C

![](causal-inference-4-5.png)
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="Answer"}
-   The correct answer is **4**.

In this case, unlike the first quiz, there is no direct path between E and D. However, C is a collider. Conditioning on C opens the path
E ← A → C ← B → D, so C does not d-separate E and D.
