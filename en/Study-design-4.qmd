### Turning a questionnaire into “data”

Me: “Hey Dad, quick question. And yes, there’s coffee.”

Dad: “Then I’m listening.”

Me: “You remember that **return-to-work survey** for cancer survivors?  
I finally drafted the questionnaire we’re going to mail from our hospital.  
Can you take a look and tell me if it’s… statistically suicidal?”

Dad: “Let’s see.”

*(He reads quietly for a minute.)*

Dad: “How exactly are you going to define the **return-to-work rate**?”

Me: “That’s already a hard question?”

Dad: “Yup. It always is.”

Me: “Okay… here’s how I was thinking.  
Among all patients who had curative surgery,  
I want to know who **has returned to work** and who **hasn’t**  
within a certain time period.  

I don’t want to restrict the denominator  
to only those who *say* they want to go back to work,  
because some people might have given up because of workplace issues.”

Dad: “Good. That’s a thoughtful choice.  
So what time window are you using?”

Me: “I don’t want to use ‘survey date’ because  
the response timing will vary a lot between patients.  
So I was thinking of defining it as:

> ‘Returned to work within 1 year after surgery.’

And then I realized…  
I should probably ask for the **actual date of return-to-work** in the questionnaire.”

Dad: “Yes, that date is very useful.  

If you have it, you can turn the same answer into:

- **Categorical data**  
  (returned within 1 year: yes/no), and  
- **Survival time data**  
  (time from discharge to return-to-work).”

Me: “Two birds with one question. Efficient.  
What about patients who **die** after surgery, though?”

Dad: “Important point.  
If someone dies after your **time origin**,  
you shouldn’t quietly drop them from the denominator.  

That would create bias—especially in a cancer survivor study.”

Me: “So what should I do?”

Dad: “In longitudinal studies for cancer patients, I always tell people:

1. Decide a clear **time origin**  
   – for you, I’d recommend the **discharge date**.  
2. Decide a **follow-up period**  
   – here, ‘1 year after discharge’.  
3. Make a serious effort to collect outcome information  
   for **all patients** in P, including deaths.

If P is ‘rectal cancer patients after curative surgery at our hospital’,  
you want to know what happened to *all* of them,  
not just the ones who kindly mail back questionnaires.”

Me: “Right. I don’t want to design a study  
where the only people included are those with good energy and good stationery habits.”

### Categorical data vs survival time data

Dad: “Let’s organize this a bit.  
What is your **outcome** in this study?”

Me: “The main one is:

> Returned to work within one year after discharge (yes/no).”

Dad: “Perfect.  
That gives you **binary data**:

- 1 = returned within 1 year  
- 0 = did not return within 1 year

You can then compute:

- the **return-to-work proportion** in each group, and  
- compare them.”

Me: “Including patients who died, as ‘did not return’, right?”

Dad: “Yes, as long as that’s clearly defined and consistent.  

But if you want a richer picture,  
you could use **three categories** instead of just two:

1. Returned within 1 year  
2. Alive but did not return within 1 year  
3. Died within 1 year without returning to work

That already separates ‘can’t work because I died’  
from ‘still alive but didn’t go back’.”

Me: “Okay, that does sound more honest.”

Dad: “Now, if you also collect the **date of return-to-work**,  
you can create **survival time data**.”

Me: “Even though the event is not ‘death’?”

Dad: “Right.  
‘Survival time’ is a bit misleading as a name.  

Statistically, what matters is:

> time from the **time origin** to the **event of interest**.

In your case, the event is ‘return-to-work’.”

Me: “So if someone is discharged on April 1  
and returns to work on April 30,  
time-to-event = 30 days.”

Dad: “Exactly.  

Now think about patients who haven’t returned to work  
by the time you close the survey.  

For them, **time-to-return** isn’t observed yet.  
That’s where **censoring** comes in.”

Me: “Right. They’re still in limbo.”

Dad: “So survival time data always comes as a **pair**:

- a time variable, and  
- an **event indicator**.

For example:

- time = min( time to return-to-work, time to last follow-up )  
- event = 1 if returned, 0 if not returned by last follow-up.”

Me: “And where do **deaths** go in that picture?”

Dad: “There are two ways to think about it.

1. A simple approach:  
   treat deaths as ‘did not return to work’,  
   and let them contribute their time until death.  
   In the event indicator, death would be coded as **no event**  
   if you only care about return-to-work.

2. A more refined approach: **competing risks**.  
   Here, death is not just ‘censored’—  
   it’s a **competing event** that prevents return-to-work from happening.”

Me: “Competing risks again.  
You really like those.”

Dad: “They show up a lot in medical data.  

If you treat all deaths as just censored,  
you’re implicitly saying:

> ‘If they hadn’t died, their chance of returning-to-work  
> would be the same as for people still alive.’

In reality, that’s often not true.”

Me: “Yeah, that would be… optimistic.”

### A quick map of data types and methods

Dad: “Since we’ve talked about data types a few times now,  
let’s draw a little map.  

Say we’re thinking about:

- what kind of **outcome** we have,  
- whether we have **repeated measurements**, and  
- whether we need to **adjust for confounding**.”

Me: “This sounds like the part where you normally pull out a slide.”

Dad: “Today we get the short version.”

| Data type         | Repeated within person? | Confounding? | Typical methods                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Continuous        | No                      | No           | t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum              |
| Continuous        | No                      | Yes          | Linear regression                      |
| Continuous        | Yes                     | Yes          | Mixed-effects model, GEE               |
| Binary (yes/no)   | No                      | No           | χ² test                                |
| Binary            | No                      | Yes          | Logistic regression                    |
| Binary            | Yes                     | Yes          | Mixed-effects logistic, GEE            |
| Count             | No                      | Yes          | Poisson regression                     |
| Survival time     | No                      | No           | Kaplan–Meier curve                     |
| Survival time     | No                      | Yes          | Cox regression                         |
| Competing risks   | No                      | No           | Aalen–Johansen curve (cumulative incidence) |
| Competing risks   | No                      | Yes          | Fine–Gray model                        |

Me: “So for my study:

- ‘Returned to work within 1 year (yes/no)’  
  → binary outcome → logistic regression.

- ‘Time from discharge to return-to-work’  
  → survival outcome → Cox regression.

And if I treat death as a competing risk for return-to-work,  
I’d use an Aalen–Johansen curve for descriptive stuff?”

Dad: “Exactly.  
That’s already a good grasp of the landscape.”

### Repeated measurements and confounding

Me: “Where do repeated measures come in?”

Dad: “Imagine you use the same questionnaire  
multiple times for each patient:

- pre-surgery  
- at 6 months  
- at 12 months

Then you’d have multiple data points **within each person**.  
Those are **correlated** — your own responses are more similar to each other  
than to some random patient’s.”

Me: “So I can’t just pretend they’re all independent.”

Dad: “Right.  
That’s when you use methods like:

- **random-effects (mixed) models**, or  
- **GEE (generalized estimating equations)**.

They’re built to handle within-person correlation.”

Me: “And confounding is the ‘third variable’ that messes with the comparison, right?”

Dad: “Exactly.  
Suppose older patients are both:

- more likely to have a stoma, and  
- less likely to return to work.

If you simply compare stoma vs no-stoma without adjusting for **age**,  
your estimated effect of stoma will be **biased**.  

That’s where logistic regression or Cox regression  
—with age and other factors—  
helps you **adjust for confounding**.”

Me: “So in randomized trials, we use randomization  
to balance those things in advance.  

But in observational studies like mine,  
we depend more on modeling and design.”

Dad: “Precisely.  
That’s the big difference between ‘trial world’ and ‘real-world data’.”

### A quiz related to this episode

In which situation is the **Kaplan–Meier method** appropriate  
for estimating a survival curve?

1. When survival times follow a normal distribution.  
2. When the reasons for censoring are unrelated to prognosis.  
3. When the censoring proportions of two groups  
   do not differ significantly in a statistical test.  
4. When the proportional hazards assumption holds  
   between the treatment and control groups.  

**Answer**

The correct answer is **2**.

Kaplan–Meier does **not** require:

- normality of survival times (that’s more for t-tests), nor  
- proportional hazards (that’s a key assumption for the Cox model).

What it *does* assume is that **censoring is non-informative**:

> Being censored is essentially independent  
> of the patient’s underlying risk of the event.

If sicker patients are more likely to be lost to follow-up,  
or if follow-up intensity depends strongly on prognosis,  
Kaplan–Meier curves can become biased.
