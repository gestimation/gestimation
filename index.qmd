Welcome.  
This is a small corner of the internet where I keep my thoughts on statistics, causal inference, and clinical research.

I believe that ideas — like good coffee — are best enjoyed while they are still warm. This site collects the tools, stories, and methods that have shaped my own way of thinking about data and medicine.

Below are the two main projects available for now.

## 1. R Package **cifmodeling**

A toolkit for survival and competing risks analysis in R.

- Kaplan–Meier and Aalen–Johansen estimation and visualization  
- Direct polytomous regression of CIFs
- Integration with **ggsurvfit**, **modelsummary**, and modern R workflows

## 2. Story and Quiz — *How I learned research from my father*

A Japanese series of short, warm stories about learning research.  
Through conversations between a father and daughter, the essentials of medical research unfold naturally.

- For readers who want to grasp the *feel* of research before opening a textbook  
- Light, conversational chapters you can read in a few minutes  
- From Study Design → Clinical Trials → Epidemiology → Causal Inference → Publishing

More content — including English blog posts, R examples, and lecture notes — will be added gradually, while the coffee is still hot.
