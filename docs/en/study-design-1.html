<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “So… you really are a professor in statistics, right?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “In Japan, yes. One of the many.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “My boss keeps telling me it’s time I do ‘some research’ and present at a conference. He’s really into supporting cancer patients in returning to work since the Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control Programs in Japan was revised. Long story short, I think he wants me to run some kind of survey. I’m not against it, but this is clearly your territory, isn’t it? Statistics and all that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Half my territory, half yours. You see the patients, I only see the data. So, do you have any <strong>clinical question or hypothesis</strong> in mind?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Honestly? Not really. I was sort of hoping I could just collect a lot of data first and think later. Is that illegal?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Not illegal, but not safe. Without at least a working hypothesis, it’s hard to design a good study.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Okay, okay. If I have to say something… I’m curious about which patients have a harder time staying in work. Not just men vs women, but things like tumor stage and treatment. I work in GI surgery, so I keep wondering about patients with a stoma. Can they really keep doing the same job as before surgery?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “That’s already a good start. You’re close to a research question.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Really? I was just thinking out loud. Fine, I guess I’ll start drafting a questionnaire. That actually helped. Thanks.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Hold on. Have you decided on your <strong>study population</strong> yet?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Um… patients with cancer who had surgery at our hospital?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Do you see many stomas in gastric cancer patients?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “It’s not impossible, but honestly, almost never.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Right. If your main interest is stomas, it might make sense to focus on cancers where stomas are common, like rectal cancer.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “So you’re saying narrow the population?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Exactly. If you <strong>narrow the target population</strong>, you can ask <strong>more detailed questions</strong> and improve <strong>comparability</strong> between groups. If you want to compare patients <em>with</em> and <em>without</em> a stoma, it’s better to keep the cancer site consistent.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Comparability…such a statistics word. But yeah, if the background is all over the place, it’s a mess. I do get that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “On the other hand, if you <strong>broaden the population</strong>, you gain <strong>generalizability</strong>. If your goal were to estimate the return-to-work rate among all cancer survivors in Japan, you wouldn’t limit the cancer site, and you might want data from multiple hospitals, not just ours.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Right now, with only our hospital, calling it a ‘real-world survey’ would be a bit bold. So ‘high generalizability’ basically means ‘other hospitals could actually use the results as a reference’?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “That’s a good way to put it. See, you <em>do</em> think statistically.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Don’t flatter me just to get free clinical consulting.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “In class, I tell my students this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When your clinical question is still vague,<br>
try to express it using PICO or PECO before you design the study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds fancy, but it’s just a framework.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “I’ve heard the words PICO, PECO…but nobody really explains what to <em>do</em> with them.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Let’s walk through it using your case. In PICO/PECO:</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>What kind of patients? (<strong>Patients/Population</strong>)<br>
</li>
<li>What factor are we focusing on? (<strong>Intervention/Exposure</strong>)<br>
</li>
<li>What are we comparing it to? (<strong>Comparison</strong>)<br>
</li>
<li>What outcomes are we interested in? (<strong>Outcome</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-father">
<p>These four pieces are like the minimum ingredients for a study recipe. In a clinical trial, we usually talk about Intervention (I). In observational studies like your survey, we talk about Exposure (E).”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Okay, P is like, ‘rectal cancer patients after curative surgery in our hospital’. For E and C… maybe ‘with stoma’ vs ‘without stoma’?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Exactly. And O is your outcome, that is to say, what you want to measure. In your case, something about return to work.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “So outcome is the thing we call OS, DFS, response rate, that kind of stuff?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Right. In statistical analysis, the <strong>outcome variable</strong> is the most important part. So deciding what the outcome is is a key step in planning.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Can I really fix that before collecting any data? Feels like I’m committing too early.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “If you don’t fix it before designing the questionnaire, you’ll regret it later. Once you start collecting data, by the way, what software are you planning to use?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “R. That’s what everyone in my department uses.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “How comfortable are you with R?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “We had it in undergrad, but at this point I’ve forgotten everything except that semicolons stress me out less than parentheses.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “So we’ll need to get you used to R again. Which R functions you use will depend on the <strong>type of outcome</strong> you choose.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “So step zero is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Turn my vague hunch into a proper question using P, E, C, O</li>
<li>Decide on the outcome<br>
</li>
<li>Then figure out how to survive R and not embarrass myself at journal club</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s the plan?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “That’s a very good summary. If you bring me questions like that, I’m happy to be used as a resource.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Deal. I’ll bring the clinical mess, you translate it into statistics. Very efficient division of labor.”</p>

Clinical questions and research hypotheses
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In everyday clinical work in Japan, you naturally start to notice small curiosities:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Do my older patients really have worse outcomes?”<br>
</li>
<li>“Is this new support program actually helping?”</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>clinical questions</strong>. To turn them into research, we want to re-express them as <strong>research hypotheses</strong>. A research hypothesis is built from the <strong>minimum elements</strong> needed for study design:</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Patients/Population</li>
<li>I/E: Intervention/Exposure</li>
<li>C: Comparison</li>
<li>O: Outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s exactly what <strong>PICO/PECO</strong> helps you write down.</p>
<hr>
<section id="example-research-hypothesis-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-research-hypothesis-1">Example: Research hypothesis 1</h4>
<p>Among rectal cancer patients after curative resection in Japan, is there a difference in <strong>return-to-work within one year</strong> between those with and without a stoma?</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Rectal cancer patients after curative resection<br>
</li>
<li>E: Stoma present<br>
</li>
<li>C: Stoma absent<br>
</li>
<li>O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you’d compare the return-to-work proportion between the stoma and non-stoma groups.</p>
<p>What to choose for C (Comparison) is important. If you only know the return-to-work rate in the stoma group, it’s hard to say whether that number is “high” or “low”.<br>
Having a clear comparison group improves interpretability.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="example-research-hypothesis-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-research-hypothesis-2">Example: Research hypothesis 2</h4>
<p>Among cancer patients after curative surgery, does providing a guidebook on balancing work and cancer treatment increase the proportion who return to work within one year?</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Patients with cancer after curative surgery<br>
</li>
<li>E: Received the guidebook<br>
</li>
<li>C: Did not receive the guidebook<br>
</li>
<li>O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here P is broader, so the results could potentially apply to a wider range of patients. This is an example of higher generalizability..</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="example-research-hypothesis-3-exploratory" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-research-hypothesis-3-exploratory">Example: Research hypothesis 3 (exploratory)</h4>
<p>“Are sex, age, stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, performance status, comorbidities, stoma, preoperative employment status, household income, cancer insurance, and use of employment support services associated with return-to-work within one year?”</p>
<p>In exploratory studies like this, P is clear, but E and C are <strong>not just one thing</strong> — we’re screening multiple potential risk factors.</p>
<p>So “structuring the question” doesn’t mean you have to force every study into a clean PECO shape. What matters is to identify the <strong>minimal set of elements</strong> needed to design a coherent study for your question.</p>
