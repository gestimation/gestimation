<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Dad, you really are a professor in statistics, right?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “In Japan, yes. One of the many.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “My boss keeps telling me it’s time I do ‘some research’ and present at a conference. He’s really into supporting cancer patients in returning to work since the Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control Programs was revised in 2016. Long story short, I think he wants me to run some kind of survey. I’m not against it, but this is clearly your territory, isn’t it? Statistics and all that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Half my territory, half yours. You see the patients, I only see the data. Do you have anything clinical you want to know? Any hypothesis?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Nope.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Without at least a working hypothesis, it’s hard to design a good study.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Seriously? I thought I could collect the data first and figure it out later. Hmm… if I had to say, I’d want to know what kind of patients have difficulty returning to work.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “For example, that men might have higher return-to-work rates than women?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “I’m interested in sex differences too, but I’m more curious about cancer stage or complications. I work in gastrointestinal surgery, and I wonder whether patients with stomas can return to the same job they had before surgery. Yeah…I’ll start drafting a questionnaire. Thanks!”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Hold on. Have you decided on your <strong>study population</strong> yet?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Hm? Patients who had cancer surgery at our hospital.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Do gastric cancer patients ever receive a stoma?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “It’s not impossible, but honestly, almost never.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Right. If your main interest is stomas, it might make sense to focus on cancers where stomas are common, like rectal cancer.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “…maybe you’re right.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “It’s important to think about who should be surveyed at the design stage. In general, narrowing the target population allows you to ask more detailed questions. And it improves <strong>comparability</strong>. If you want to compare patients with and without stomas, you’d want the cancer type to be consistent.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “You really love using difficult words. But I get it. If patients’ backgrounds vary too much, it becomes hard to compare them. Keeping them similar makes things easier.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “There are statistical methods and R packages to improve comparability too, like <code>glm()</code> for regression adjustment, or<code>CBPS()</code> for propensity score weighting. But on the other hand, a broader study population increases <strong>generalizability</strong>. If you want to estimate return-to-work rates among cancer survivors, you don’t necessarily need to limit the cancer type. Ideally, you’d collect data from multiple institutions.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “True…it feels strange to call it ‘a survey of cancer survivors’ if it’s only our hospital. Generalizability means gathering data that are useful for other hospitals too, right?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “In class, I tell my students this:“</p>
</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When your clinical question is still vague,<br>
try to express it using PICO or PECO before you design the study.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: It sounds fancy, but we call that ‘structuring’ a study.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Structuring…? That sounds suspiciously formal. Okay, I’ve heard the word before.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Then let’s go through it lightly. In PICO/PECO, P stands for Patients or Population. Deciding who your patients are is a key element in study design.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Which patients or population are being studied (P)</li>
<li>What exposure or intervention is of interest (E/I)</li>
<li>What they are compared against (C)</li>
<li>What outcomes will be evaluated (O)</li>
</ul>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “I’ve never heard of Exposure or Comparison before…But in my case, it would be patients with versus without a stoma, right? And what’s Outcome?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Exactly. And O is treatment results, prognosis, and endpoints of patients. In statistical analysis, the outcome variable is the most important part. So it’s crucial to define it before you begin.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Can you even define it before the data come in?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “You should, because once the data are collected, you can’t revise it any more.It needs to be set before finalizing the questionnaire. Right…you probably don’t have a concrete image of an outcome yet. But the outcome determines which data you’ll collect and which statistical methods you’ll use. By the way, which software are you planning to use once the data are ready?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “R. My seniors in the department use it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Are you comfortable with R?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “I took a class in college, but I’ve forgotten most of it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Then you’ll need to relearn it. And which R functions you use depends entirely on your outcome.”</p>

Clinical questions and research hypotheses
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In daily clinical practice, many questions naturally arise. A question emerging directly from clinical experience is called a clinical question.</p>
<p>When starting a clinical research, what matters is expressing that <strong>clinical question</strong> as a <strong>research hypothesis</strong>. A research hypothesis consists of minimal essential elements, often summarized using PICO/PECO:</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Patients/Population</li>
<li>I/E: Intervention/Exposure</li>
<li>C: Comparison</li>
<li>O: Outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>The I (Intervention) or E (Exposure) differs depending on whether your study is an interventional trial or an observational study such as a cohort, case?control, or cross-sectional study. All can be structured using PECO.</p>
<p>Here are three examples of research hypotheses using the cancer survivor survey as a theme.</p>
<hr>
<section id="example-research-hypothesis-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-research-hypothesis-1">Example: Research hypothesis 1</h4>
<p>Among rectal cancer patients after curative resection in Japan, is there a difference in <strong>return-to-work within one year</strong> between those with and without a stoma?</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Rectal cancer patients after curative resection<br>
</li>
<li>E: Stoma present<br>
</li>
<li>C: Stoma absent<br>
</li>
<li>O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you’d compare the return-to-work proportion between the stoma and non-stoma groups.</p>
<p>What to choose for C (Comparison) is important. If you only know the return-to-work rate in the stoma group, it’s hard to say whether that number is “high” or “low”.<br>
Having a clear comparison group improves interpretability.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="example-research-hypothesis-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-research-hypothesis-2">Example: Research hypothesis 2</h4>
<p>Among cancer patients after curative surgery, does providing a guidebook on balancing work and cancer treatment increase the proportion who return to work within one year?</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Patients with cancer after curative surgery<br>
</li>
<li>E: Received the guidebook<br>
</li>
<li>C: Did not receive the guidebook<br>
</li>
<li>O: Returned to work within one year after surgery (yes/no)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here P is broader, so the results could potentially apply to a wider range of patients. This is an example of higher generalizability.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="example-research-hypothesis-3-exploratory" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-research-hypothesis-3-exploratory">Example: Research hypothesis 3 (exploratory)</h4>
<p>“Are sex, age, stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, performance status, comorbidities, stoma, preoperative employment status, household income, cancer insurance, and use of employment support services associated with return-to-work within one year?”</p>
<p>In exploratory studies like this, P is clear, but E and C are <strong>not just one thing</strong> — we’re screening multiple potential risk factors.</p>
<p>So “structuring the question” doesn’t mean you have to force every study into a clean PECO shape. What matters is to identify the <strong>minimal set of elements</strong> needed to design a coherent study for your question.</p>
</section>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: ”I see…it would be tough to propose an original hypothesis from scratch, but breaking the study down into components and deciding one by one isn’t so bad. I suppose it’s something I’ll need to learn eventually.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Father: “Exactly. Plus, replacing your thinking with specialized terminology early on improves communication. Definitions of diseases and outcomes, detailed treatment regimens, and exposure specifics can varysubtly across clinicians and facilities. If the terminology is vague, confusion follows.”</p>

<hr>
<p>This post is the second episode of my Story and Quiz series. Over a cup of coffee, a clinician daughter and her statistician father build a rough mental map from data types (continuous, binary, count, survival) to common R functions: <code>mean()</code>, <code>t.test()</code>, <code>glm()</code>, <code>fisher.test()</code>, <code>survfit()</code>, and <code>cifplot()</code>. We simulate a small stoma-surgery dataset in R, look at histograms, tables, and survival curves, and end with a short quiz about oncology endpoints and FDA approvals. If you’d like to start from the beginning, you can find the first episode here:</p>

<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Okay, coffee is ready. Can I keep you a bit longer?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “If coffee is involved, yes.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “You said something earlier that stuck with me: the R function we use depends on the outcome. I didn’t really get that. In the end, aren’t all data just … numbers?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “They’re all numbers, yes. But for statistics, the <strong>type of data</strong> matters a lot. Very roughly, we use four big categories.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Continuous data</li>
<li>Binary / categorical data</li>
<li>Count data</li>
<li>Survival time data</li>
</ul>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “<strong>Continuous data</strong> is things we measure, right? Like age or blood pressure. Binary data I get — like ‘with stoma’ vs ‘without stoma’ in the study I want to do.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Perfect. <strong>Count data</strong> is when you literally count events, like the number of traffic accidents. <strong>Survival data</strong> is things like lifespan — time from some starting point until an event, such as death. In your case, that could be time from surgery to returning to work, or time to relapse.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “When you say it like that, they definitely feel like different beasts. But in the R course I took, we just typed whatever they put on the slides — <code>t.test()</code>, <code>glm()</code>, <code>survfit()</code>… It all felt like a spellbook.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “That’s a common side effect of R lectures. Do you have your laptop?”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “That sounds like the beginning of homework.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Let’s just say it’s a practical demonstration. Bring it here — we’ll install RStudio if it’s not there.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “I knew this was coming. Look, I know my stats skills are still beginner level, and I <em>do</em> need R for my own research. So fine, I’ll get my laptop. But I expect maximum efficiency from this session.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “I’ll try. In R, for <strong>continuous data</strong>, we often use <code>mean()</code> and <code>t.test()</code>.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">

<p>Dad: “For statistics, we imagine that behind the data there’s some probability distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous data: often <strong>normal distribution</strong></li>
<li>Binary data: <strong>binomial distribution</strong></li>
<li>Count data: <strong>Poisson distribution</strong></li>
<li>Survival data: there’s no single standard, but a simple one is the <strong>exponential distribution</strong>. Often, though, we just treat it <strong>nonparametrically</strong> without any specific distributions.</li>

<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “For example, we often talk about <strong>proportions</strong> and <strong>rates</strong> in medicine. We casually throw around words like prevalence or mortality rate. But in statistics they are clearly different.”</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Proportion: a parameter of the binomial distribution<br>
</li>
<li>Rate: a parameter of Poisson distribution</li>
</ul>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “But in normal conversation, proportion and rate are almost interchangeable.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Right, in everyday language they get blurred. In a scientific context, they’re different. A proportion is something you’d express as a <strong>percentage</strong>, such as “60% of the participants were women.” It is clearly bounded between 0 and 1, and describes ’how many out of this group’. A rate relates to <strong>events over time</strong>, and is expressed per unit of time. For example, think of annual rate of traffic accidents in Tokyo. You wouldn’t express that as ’120% per year’. It’s something like ’X accidents per year’.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “Okay, that’s finally clicking. So proportion is like ‘out of this group, how many have the characteristic’, and rate is like ‘how fast things are happening over time’.”</p>
</div>
<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Exactly. And with that in mind, let’s do a small R demo — nothing painful.”</p>

<div class="voice-daughter">
<p>Me: “You always say that right before something painful.”</p>

<div class="voice-father">
<p>Dad: “Deal. First, a quick note about R packages. To <strong>install</strong> a package on your computer, you use <code>install.packages()</code>. To <strong>use</strong> an installed package in your current session, you use <code>library()</code>. R is like a bookshelf.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>

<p>This quiz connects the idea of outcomes to real drug approvals in oncology. From 2009 to 2014, 83 drugs in the oncology field were approved by the FDA. Select the correct percentage of these 83 drugs that were approved based on clinical trials using response rate (tumor shrinkage or complete remission) as the primary endpoint.</p>

<p>According to the review by Kim and Prasad (2016), 31 out of 83 products were reported to have been approved based on response rate results. Furthermore, the breakdown of endpoints differs between standard approval and accelerated approval. For standard approval, 48 out of 55 products were evaluated based on overall survival, progression-free survival, or disease-free survival. In contrast, for accelerated approval, the majority of products were based on Phase II trial results where response rate was the primary endpoint.</p>
